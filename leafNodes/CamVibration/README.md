Verification Method:
---

use FEA to determine sensible locations for shakers/stingers and
accelerometers. Measure transfer functions for each accelerometer
mount point. Measure vibration from refridgeration system and filter
change and shutter cycles. Use these to validate FEA model. Validated
FEA model will then be used together with T&S-provided vibration PSD
for estimating vibrations on detector plane and camera
optics. Camera-induced vibration data will be given to T&S for
estimating impact on telescope optics.
