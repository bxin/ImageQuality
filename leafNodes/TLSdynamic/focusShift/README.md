Verification Method:
---

Measure thermal profiles during an exposure and through the night. These measurements will be combined with FEA results and optical sensitivity to deterimine contribution to the IQ budget.

also need to pay attention to whether the total drift during a night is adequately covered by the travel range of the hexapods, and the resolution of the hexapod z-motion is adequate for correcting the system after each exposure.
