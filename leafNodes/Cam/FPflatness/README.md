Verification Method:
---

This include three parts: sensor flatness; raft assembly; and detector plane assembly

This will be measured by Camera team using metrology systems. Individual metrology exposures stitiched together. Will be done during sensor acceptance and I&T. 

Need as measured height map for final analysis. Note that the corresponding PV requirement is +/-11um for the entire focal plane.
