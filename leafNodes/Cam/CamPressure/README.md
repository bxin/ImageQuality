Verification Method:

L1-L2 pressure differential can be inferred from airflow
measurements. These results can be used in two ways. (1) scale up IQ
estimates based on earlier FEA analysis and its inputs (2) redo the
FEA analysis with updated model.

For L3 pressure-induced, deflection
and piston will be measured under vacuum at the vendor on a test
chamber, which will validate the model. AOS optimization should be
taken into account either by optimizing camera hexapod only, or
optimizing two mirrors and two hexapods. The latter requires the FEA
output to be used as AOS simulation input.
