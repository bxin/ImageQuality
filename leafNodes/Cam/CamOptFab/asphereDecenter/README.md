Verification Method:
---

Two aspheric surfaces in the camera: L2S2 and L3S1.
L1L2 is aligned to the Best Fit Optical Axis (BFOA), which is defined by the Focal Plane (FP) and L3.
This term in only for L2 in the error budget.

This is also called aspheric slide.
Need to calculate the correponding decenter and tilt. These can then be modeled in Zemax for image quality evaluation.
