Verification Method:
---

Charge diffusion is measured by making Gaussian fits to 55Fe X-ray clusters. 
Gaussianity is supported by references in NIM article (see below technical notes section). 
If time permits, Camera I&T will also make the cosmic-ray based measurements.

This will be modeled as a symmetric Gaussian in system analysis, and convolved with other PSF components just like the atmosphere.
