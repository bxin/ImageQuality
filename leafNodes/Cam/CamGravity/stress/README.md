Verification Method:
---

use the measurements described in leafNodes/CamGravity/correlated/ and
leafNodes/CamGravity/uncorrelated/ to validate the FEA model. Update
the stress analysis in Document-8162 and Document-8525, using the
updated model.
Stress can be converted into change in refraction index, which can then be modeled in Zemax as a surface sag (conservative estimate)
