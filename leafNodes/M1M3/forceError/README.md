Verification Method:
---
Need actuator non-repeating force error measurements (LTS-MSS-REQ-0008). We can have some random realizations of the force error map. Multiplying these with mirror influence matrix gives the mirror shapes. Inserting the mirror shapes into the Zemax model gives estimated of IQ at GQ fields.
