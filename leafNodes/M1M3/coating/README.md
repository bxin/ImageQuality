Verification Method:
---

(1) The surface roughness will be measured. We can then evaluate the impact on image quality (PSSN) and on sky background. (2) The coating plant will provide us data on the amount of material deposited in areas of the mirror surface. We will do metrology measurements on samples, to make sure the two sources are consistent. #2 should have negligible impact on image quality.
