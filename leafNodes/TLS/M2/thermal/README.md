Verification Method:
---
Similar to M1M3, it is unlikely that we will update the M2 thermal FEA.

Need thermal gradient measurements, in Z and radial directions. 
We shall then reuse earlier FEA results, and scale up the resulting image size based on earlier analysis. 
These need to be used as input to AOS simulations, because the low order deformations will be taken out by the AOS. The difference in AOS output IQ with and without this input will be due to this source.
