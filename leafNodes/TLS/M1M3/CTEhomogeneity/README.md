Verification Method:
---
CTE was measured from samples before glass was melted. These ware used in FEA model, and a temperature change of 25C was assumed for estimating mirror shape change and impact on wavefront error.

Note that 25C is much larger than the difference between typical lab and summit environments (20C vs 11C)
