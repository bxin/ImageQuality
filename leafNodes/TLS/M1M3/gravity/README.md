Verification Method:
---
M1M3 was polished facing up. No additional G-induced surface error. 
We will not be able to measure the M1M3 surface at 30 or 60 degree zenith angles.
Need to use the LSST consolidated FEA model to derive off-zenith printthroughs at 30 and 60 degrees. Then check the GQ of FWHM is less than secZ^0.6
