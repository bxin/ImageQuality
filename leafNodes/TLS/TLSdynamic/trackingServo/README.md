Verification Method:
---
image degradation due to Guider loop can be estimated using the Guider/Mount Servo Loop, with the centroid noise as input.
Centroid noise can be calculated using on sky guider images, and checked against predictions using as-measured read noise and sky background etc. 
The final Guider/Mount Servo Loop will be used for this evaluation.
