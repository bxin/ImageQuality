Verification Method:
---
Boundary conditions that have been used by the CFD analayes will be updated with real measurements, including temperature at various positions and wind speed and direction.
We will also directly estimate the dome seeing by looking at the difference as measured by the inside and outside DIMMs, and using the dedicated Dome Seeing Minitor.

We can use the measured dome seeing to calibrate the CFD model, which would be useful to the community.
